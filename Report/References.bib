	abstract = {Post-depositional modifications or alterations of the surface of lithics artefacts have been characterised at both macroscopic and microscopic scales by means of qualitative criteria. Here we introduce a new methodology for the study of surface alterations based on roughness measurements using confocal microscopy. This new approach allows for a quantified and reproducible distinction between various states of alteration among geological samples and archaeological material from a level attributed to the Châtelperronian at La Roche-à-Pierrot (Saint-Césaire, France). This site, perhaps best known for discovery of Neanderthal remains in a level attributed to the Châtelperronian, plays a critical role in questions concerning the emergence of the Upper Palaeolithic and its relation to the appearance of anatomically modern humans in Western Europe. In this context, the question of the chrono-cultural integrity of the Châtelperronian at Saint-Césaire is crucial. Our results demonstrate considerable variability in surface alterations among a sample of specific artefacts, Châtelperronian points, and those collected in the immediate vicinity of the Neanderthal remains and thus reinforces previous arguments concerning the unreliability of the Neanderthal-Châtelperronian association at Saint-Césaire. This pilot study equally confirms the potential of roughness analysis for both taphonomic and use-wear studies of lithic industries.},

An assumption behind this dichotomy is that artifact assemblages (and assodated bones and other remains) located in low energy settings (e.g., fine sediments, lakeshore margins) can be directly related to early human activities, while assemblages in high energy settings (e.g., coarse sediments, river banks) offer little information about behavior. In this paper aiteria are examined that may prove effective in distinguishing the diverse influences potentially exerted by flowing water on artifact assemblages. These aiteria are used to analyze lithic assemblages from five excavated sites In Olduvai Gorge (1.8-1.2 my). The Olduvai sites are placed on a relative scale of influence by water flow. By assessing the variable effects of moving water on archeological sites, a more informed perspective is expected about the potential behavioral content of early human sites.},

	abstract = {In Australia a number of taphonomic studies suggest that natural processes may cause stone artefacts to move vertically within a site (Stockton 1973, Hughes and Lampert 1977, Stern 1980), and to move around the landscape (Cane 1982). There seems to be a consensus amongst Australian archaeologists that, while stone artefacts may be moved vertically or horizontally, they are virtually indestructible. Consequently it is believed that interpreting artefact numbers and morphologies requires no taphonomic perspective at all. This paper argues that in order to derive information about the past from the \{\vphantom{\}}lrchaeological record it is necessary to have a taphonomic perspective on morphological characteristics of stone artefacts. The framework of taphonomy is discussed and it is claimed that the taphonomic processes which act upon bone can equally modify stone, and that the main objectives of taphonomic studies in palaeontology can be achieved in the study of prehistoric artefacts. Two case studies are presented to demonstrate the mutability of stone artefacts.},

	abstract = {Many Paleolithic lithic collections are found in contexts where post-depositional alterations, such as those made by water streams or sedimentary displacement, have affected the surface of most of the lithic artifacts. A major alteration often observed is the rounding of lithic artifacts. Although there have been some proposals on how to classify degrees of rounding—usually by employing naked eye classifications to determine degrees of rounding—there is a lack of consensus among lithic analysts. The aim of this study is to define and characterize degrees of rounding among lithic artifacts. This characterization also takes into consideration the differential development of alterations and rounding stages, depending on the raw materials. Here, an experimental program has been developed along with supplementary archaeological analysis to define and characterize degrees of rounding. Degrees of rounding are characterized according to three criteria: surface alteration, edge alteration, and width of the ridges. A preliminary characterization and proposal of degrees of rounding is presented. This characterization also takes into consideration the raw materials and the sensibility and resolution of the criteria to establish degrees of rounding. Results show how, after microscopic analysis, lithic artifacts that appear fresh to the naked present different degrees of rounding. The conclusions explain that, although rounding is continuous process, it is possible to establish degrees of rounding, a main initial goal for any lithic analyst.},

SSFA has been recently integrated to the software MountainsMap® as an optional module. Meanwhile, Toothfrax support has ended. Before switching to the new module, the outputs between the two software packages must be compared for consistency. We have performed such a test using Bayesian modelling on three datasets including dental surfaces of sheep (Merceron, Ramdarshan, et al., 2016) and guinea pigs (Winkler, Schulz-Kornas, Kaiser, Cuyper, et al., 2019) from controlled feeding experiments, as well as surfaces of quartzite and ﬂint ﬂakes used in an actualistic archeological experiment on cleaning procedures (Pedergnana, Calandra, Bob, et al., 2020). We found that the two software packages calculate signiﬁcantly diﬀerent values for the SSFA parameters epLsar, Asfc, HAsfc9 and R2, even when the same settings are used. Nevertheless, the treatments (diﬀerent diets or cleaning procedures) are discriminated similarly within each dataset. While the new software module is as good as the original software to diﬀerentiate treatments, our results imply that the outputs from the two software packages are not directly comparable and, as such, cannot be merged. Surface texture analysts should therefore consider re-analyzing published surfaces before integrating them in their studies.},

              th
              century. Studies of use-wear analysis have decisively contributed to a better understanding of the cognitive capacities and the socio-economic organization of Prehistoric societies. Among use-wear traces, microwear polish is the most relevant evidence, as it allows the identification of the worked materials (i.e. wood, antler, hide, bone, stone…). This identification is currently carried out through the qualitative and visual comparison of experimental and archaeological tools. During the last decade, confocal microscopy is allowing the quantitative identification of the worked material through the texture analysis of microwear polish. Previous tests have accounted for the variability of use-wear traces as caused by different types of worked material. However, how the intensity of use, which is widely recognized as an important factor conditioning microwear polish characteristics, affects our capacity to identify the worked materials is poorly understood. This research addresses the dynamic nature of microwear polish through confocal microscopy and texture analysis. This research shows that use-wear polishing is a dynamic process and surface texture evolves continuously during the working time. The evolution fits a logarithmic function, so most texture modification takes place during the first phases of work. The way in which polish texture evolves through time differs from one contact material to the other. We demonstrate that, despite the dynamic nature of use-wear polish, different worked materials can be discriminated. However, some overlapping between used and unused surfaces and between worked materials occurs in the first stages of use. Moreover, polishes of similar characteristics (i.e. bone and antler) can show similar texture at advanced stages of use. These problems in identification can be in good measure overcome by creating dynamic models of polish texture in which not only the worked material but also the time of use is considered.},

Originally, diﬀerent types of “patina” were deﬁned as “white patina”, “glossy patina”, or “porcelain-like patina”, all of which involved changes in the color and/or roughness of the initial raw material. Alteration degrees are used in many research ﬁelds like taphonomy, petroarchaeology or use-wear analysis; however most of these studies are still based on qualitative descriptions using a wide range of terms that bring about confusion. In this paper, we present ﬁrst the results of an inter-observer's blind-test where color and roughness are described at macroscopic scale. Secondly, we use quantitative methods to compare archaeological and experimental altered siliciﬁcations: light spectrometry and confocal microscopy are used to quantify color and roughness. We show here how macroscopic qualitative descriptions could lead to confusion because of the lack of calibration and the number of terms used diﬀerently by each one. We demonstrated the eﬃciency of quantitative methods as light spectrometry and confocal microscopy that will signiﬁcantly enhance studies of surface alteration in terms of taphonomy, use-wear analyses, and petroarchaeology issues as well as interdisciplinary discussions.},

	abstract = {The key problem restricting lithic microwear analysis is the lack of quantitative analysis to support qualitative assessments of different wear traces. This paper presents the reﬂective laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) as a new technique for the study of lithic microwear that has the potential to resolve this problem. Firstly, an example is presented that shows how the LSCM compares with conventional reﬂected light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. This shows that images, rivalling that of the SEM, can be produced in similar timescales to conventional photomicrography and with no need for casting or sample preparation. The LSCM is also used to measure surface roughness of use-wear produced from working hide (dry, fresh and greasy), woodworking and antler working. This analysis demonstrates clear differences between the different wear polishes and the potential of the LSCM as a quantitative approach in lithic microwear research.},

	abstract = {This pilot study tests the reliability of laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) to quantitatively measure wear on experimental obsidian tools. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst use of confocal microscopy to study wear on stone ﬂakes made from an amorphous silicate like obsidian. Three-dimensional surface roughness or texture area scans on three obsidian ﬂakes used on different contact materials (hide, shell, wood) were documented using the LSCM to determine whether the worn surfaces could be discriminated using areascale analysis, speciﬁcally relative area (RelA). When coupled with the F-test, this scale-sensitive fractal analysis could not only discriminate the used from unused surfaces on individual tools, but was also capable of discriminating the wear histories of tools used on different contact materials. Results indicate that such discriminations occur at different scales. Conﬁdence levels for the discriminations at different scales were established using the F-test (mean square ratios or MSRs). In instances where discrimination of surface roughness or texture was not possible above the established conﬁdence level based on MSRs, photomicrographs and RelA assisted in hypothesizing why this was so.

The importance of these assemblages concerns the uniquely long-term perspectives that they offer to the study of early hominin occupation histories and landscape use. The factors explored (river type, bedrock type, the chronology and cycles of fl uvial activity, and confl uence activity) build upon the previous work of D.R. Bridgland, and A.J. Howard and M.G. Macklin with regard to terrace formation, preservation, and other fl uvial activity. Particular emphasis is placed upon short-term fl uvial activity (the context for assemblage formation) and the long-term potential for preservation and erosion of fl uvial terraces and their archaeological contents. Case study examples are presented for the Solent River and the River Axe on the British south coast, exploring geoarchaeological issues within the context of understanding assemblage taphonomy and hominin behavior at local and regional scales.

This paper discusses the spatial artefact distribution of five recently excavated, open-air exposed Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites in Ntwetwe Pan, Botswana. The finds comprise lithic assemblages dominated by MSA points, manufactured in a variety of silcretes. The sites were examined following the assumption that archaeological sites are the product of a combination of natural and cultural factors, occurring both during and after artefacts are deposited. The results indicate that some of these exposed pan floor sites do preserve cultural artefact distribution patterns, and that the level of post-depositional disturbance varies locally. Refitting was an important tool of analysis, especially on the largest site, MAK33, where it was possible to identify working areas that focussed on different modes of lithic manufacture. In combination with a chaîne opératoire analysis of lithic production stages, it was then possible to map movement of artefacts across the site. We argue that the spatial organization of open-air sites may preserve behavioural records that are not present at caves and rock shelters, and provide a view into the short-term, single-use locations that likely formed the basis of MSA occupation patterns.},

This perspective encompasses the integration of data provided by a number of sources (such as soil micro-morphology, archaeo-stratigraphy, site formation studies, or lithic conjoining) in order to identify minimal behavioral entities in archaeological palimpsests. To date, this type of approach has been applied to African ESA contexts only cursorily. Here, we present the results of our methodological effort in order to make progress towards meeting some of the basic standards of current high-resolution approaches in the East African ESA record, revolving around the concept of synchronicity. This approach has been applied to the newly discovered site of SHK Extension, adjacent to and pene-contemporaneous with the classical SHK Main site (Olduvai Gorge), where a total area of 30 m2 has been unearthed. By a detailed archaeo-stratigraphic study of the archaeological sequence, in combination with other procedures focusing on the micro scale of the spatial analysis, we can confidently dissect the different archaeo-units of this anthropogenic aggregate. These archaeo-units must be interpreted as micro-palimpsests showing a level of synchronicity as accurate as possible. In the present work, this methodology constitutes the referential criterion for assemblage grouping and it is the baseline for the subsequent technological study of the different anthropogenic entities identified at SHK Extension.},

                Technology in microscopy advances rapidly, enabling increasingly affordable, faster, and more precise quantitative biomedical imaging, which necessitates correspondingly more‐advanced image processing and analysis techniques. A wide range of software is available—from commercial to academic, special‐purpose to Swiss army knife, small to large—but a key characteristic of software that is suitable for scientific inquiry is its accessibility. Open‐source software is ideal for scientific endeavors because it can be freely inspected, modified, and redistributed; in particular, the open‐software platform ImageJ has had a huge impact on the life sciences, and continues to do so. From its inception, ImageJ has grown significantly due largely to being freely available and its vibrant and helpful user community. Scientists as diverse as interested hobbyists, technical assistants, students, scientific staff, and advanced biology researchers use ImageJ on a daily basis, and exchange knowledge via its dedicated mailing list. Uses of ImageJ range from data visualization and teaching to advanced image processing and statistical analysis. The software's extensibility continues to attract biologists at all career stages as well as computer scientists who wish to effectively implement specific image‐processing algorithms. In this review, we use the ImageJ project as a case study of how open‐source software fosters its suites of software tools, making multitudes of image‐analysis technology easily accessible to the scientific community. We specifically explore what makes ImageJ so popular, how it impacts the life sciences, how it inspires other projects, and how it is self‐influenced by coevolving projects within the ImageJ ecosystem.

Such techniques have been mostly applied to fine-grained rocks (chert), while studies on coarse-grained raw materials have been relatively infrequent. In this study, confocal microscopy was employed to investigate polished surfaces on a coarse-grained lithology, quartzite. Wear originating from contact with five different worked materials were classified in a data-driven approach using machine learning. Two different classifiers, a decision tree and a support-vector machine, were used to assign the different textures to a worked material based on a selected number of parameters (

However, these materials can undergo multiple post-depositional alterations after their introduction into the archaeological record. Due to the high quantity of lithic remains recovered, a quick, flexible, and effective method for identifying degrees of alteration on the surface of lithic implements is highly desirable. The present study examines the use of gray level images to obtain quantitative data from the surface of flint artifacts and determine whether these images can detect the presence of post-depositional alterations. An experimental collection of flints was subjected to sequential episodes of rounding in a tumbling machine. After each episode, photographs were taken with a microscope, resulting in quantitative surface values using gray level values. The quantitative surface values were used as variables in machine learning models to determine time of exposure and the most salient variables for discrimination. Our results indicate that the extraction of metrics from gray level images successfully capture changes in the surface of flint artifacts caused by post-depositional processes. Additional results provide insight into which areas to sample when seeking post-depositional alterations and underscore the importance of particle size in the generation of alterations.},

	abstract = {Alterations caused by post-depositional processes have long hampered functional analysis of stone tools, and several attempts have been made to understand their effect on the visibility and identification of use-related traces and residues. Alterations can be caused by a broad range of phenomena that involve both mechanical and chemical processes. In this article, we present the results of an experimental study focused on the reproduction of alterations caused by repeated freeze–thaw cycles, which are among the crucial processes that many prehistoric artefacts have been subjected to after their deposition. Thanks to the use of a climate chamber, we succeeded in reproducing alteration polish comparable to what is frequently observed on prehistoric stone tools, in particular those dating to the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods. The results open new possibilities for exploring the effect of post-depositional processes on the preservation of use traces and residues and demonstrate that alterations can also contribute to the understanding of site formation processes.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a method to study the degree of change that affected a prehistoric context as the result of environmental processes. It is based on the direct examination of a representative sample of stone tool by-products, and on the identification of all surface alteration features. We summarize the theoretical bases for the formation of some wear features and the main results of a number of experiments involving interaction between chert flakes and sediments. Experimental results include: (1) the wear rate of flakes is not constant; (2) the wear rate increases as the size of the grains that compose the matrix increases; (3) fine grained chert resists wear better then coarse grained chert; and (4) the presence of moisture will trigger some chemical reactions that promote wear and the formation of films on chert surfaces. We apply these findings to the cave site of Grotta di Pozzo, Italy, and conclude that, strictly within the area sampled, there is low degree of disturbance and low intensity of chemical processes that may, however, confound the reconstruction of human activities in this part of the cave.},

	abstract = {The Miocene of the Madrid basin includes relatively abundant silica rocks (cherts, opals and opaline cherts), which were used during the Palaeolithic and Neolithic to make lithic tools. This work establishes the chemical characteristics that can be used to classify those silica rocks on the basis of their geographical location, explaining at the same time their mineralogical, petrological and geochemical features. The geographical classification of silica rocks is very useful to define the source areas of lithic tools made during the Prehistory. The mineralogical and petrological classification was made using transmitted light optical microscopy, X-Ray diffraction and Raman spectrometry. Chemical analyses of major, minor and rare elements were performed using Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) mass and emission spectrometry. Most of the silica rocks from the Miocene of the Madrid basin were formed by the replacement of sedimentary rocks that constitute the infill of the basin. This process implies the dissolution of the host rock (limestone, dolostone, gypsum, clays, etc.) and the precipitation of silica minerals (quartz, opaline phases and moganite). Both, the chemical composition of the host rock relicts and the elements incorporated by the opaline phases, constitutes a characteristic geochemical signature from each sampled zone (sample group). Therefore, this signature can be used to define and characterize silica rocks on the basis of their geographical location. The study of the data was carried out using bivariate analysis (i.e. correlation coefficients) and multivariate analysis (i.e. main components and the discriminant function). All the chemical elements analyzed are important in the discriminant analysis, because when fewer elements are taken into account (even when only those elements with a lower weight in the discriminant function are removed), the number of samples that can be included in the groups decreases importantly.},

	abstract = {The research during the construction of the M-50 highway has allowed the study of the silica levels that constitute the most important Neolithic flint mine in the Iberian Peninsula. A group of more than 3.800 extraction pits were realized to obtain cherts and opals that appear among Mg smectites beds (Aragonian deposits). The description of the nodular and stratiform silica levels and the study of their types and distribution have been done at geological sections obtained during the archaeological excavations. Three petrological types of siliceous rocks (chert, opal and opaline chert) are established and defined according to their mineralogy and microfacies. Cherts are constituted only by quartz and locally minor amounts of moganite. Opals contain opal CT, Mg smectites and minor quartz. Opaline chert is defined when the proportion of quartz is higher than 50\%. All the types of siliceous rocks reproduce bioturbation structures as well as other structures found in the host rocks (grains, intraclasts, brecciation). The silica levels at the base of the columns are constituted only by chert and were formed by the silicification of nodular and lenticular dolomite levels included in the Mg-smectites beds. The rest of the siliceous levels are composed of opals and opaline cherts and were formed by silicification of Mg-smectites. The outer part of the opaline chert has a higher content in opal and clay relicts whereas the inner part is mainly microcrystalline quartz. This change is consequence of the recrystallization of the opal (aging) producing a more compact silica rock. The main silicification occurred under the groundwater table because the structure of the host rocks is conserved in the silica rocks. A general question is whether the silica that precipites is introduced by groundwater or it is released from the dissolution of clays during their replacement.},

In fact, its rather non-descript character is a large part of its definition and, while not technically the type site for the Tayacian, the cave site of Fontéchevade with its thick deposits of Tayacian and detailed publication has served as an important reference for this industry. Here we report on our recent re-excavation of the site and study of the existing collections. Based on this work it is clear that the Tayacian of Fontéchevade is largely a result of taphonomic factors of mainly natural origin that brought together unworked, fractured flints from the cave walls, rolled worked and unworked flints from the overlying plateau, gravels from the overlying plateau that were interpreted as hammerstones, and infrequent occurrences of stone artifacts that may in fact have been manufactured in place or at least deposited there by hominins. As a result we suggest that the term Tayacian should no longer be used to describe lithic assemblages and that archaeologists need to continue to be careful linking archaeological assemblages to shared patterns of behavior that might be interpreted as Paleolithic cultures.},
