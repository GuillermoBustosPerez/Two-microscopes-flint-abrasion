	abstract = {Archeologists have typically judged the effects of water flow on sites in terms of the simple dichotomy between primaly and secondary (or derived) context. An assumption behind this dichotomy is that artifact assemblages (and assodated bones and other remains) located in low energy settings (e.g., fine sediments, lakeshore margins) can be directly related to early human activities, while assemblages in high energy settings (e.g., coarse sediments, river banks) offer little information about behavior. In this paper aiteria are examined that may prove effective in distinguishing the diverse influences potentially exerted by flowing water on artifact assemblages. These aiteria are used to analyze lithic assemblages from five excavated sites In Olduvai Gorge (1.8-1.2 my). The Olduvai sites are placed on a relative scale of influence by water flow. By assessing the variable effects of moving water on archeological sites, a more informed perspective is expected about the potential behavioral content of early human sites.},

	isbn = {978-0-8137-2476-8},
	abstract = {Key geoarchaeological factors are explored with reference to the formation and potential preservation and/or loss of early Paleolithic artifact assemblages within Pleistocene fl uvial deposits. The importance of these assemblages concerns the uniquely long-term perspectives that they offer to the study of early hominin occupation histories and landscape use. The factors explored (river type, bedrock type, the chronology and cycles of fl uvial activity, and confl uence activity) build upon the previous work of D.R. Bridgland, and A.J. Howard and M.G. Macklin with regard to terrace formation, preservation, and other fl uvial activity. Particular emphasis is placed upon short-term fl uvial activity (the context for assemblage formation) and the long-term potential for preservation and erosion of fl uvial terraces and their archaeological contents. Case study examples are presented for the Solent River and the River Axe on the British south coast, exploring geoarchaeological issues within the context of understanding assemblage taphonomy and hominin behavior at local and regional scales. The paper concludes by assessing the potential and limitations of the approaches outlined.},

	abstract = {Fluvial redeposition of stone artifacts is a major complicating factor in the interpretation of Lower Palaeolithic open-air archaeological sites. However, the microscopic examination of lithic surfaces may provide valuable background information on the transport history of artifacts, particularly in low energy settings. Replica flint artifacts were therefore abraded in an annular flume and examined with a scanning electron microscope. Results showed that abrasion time, sediment size, and artifact transport mode were very sensitive predictors of microscopic surface abrasion, ridge width, and edge damage (p {\textless} 0.000). These results suggest that patterns of micro-abrasion of stone artifacts may enhance understanding of archaeological assemblage formation in fluvial contexts},

	abstract = {Alterations caused by post-depositional processes have long hampered functional analysis of stone tools, and several attempts have been made to understand their effect on the visibility and identification of use-related traces and residues. Alterations can be caused by a broad range of phenomena that involve both mechanical and chemical processes. In this article, we present the results of an experimental study focused on the reproduction of alterations caused by repeated freeze–thaw cycles, which are among the crucial processes that many prehistoric artefacts have been subjected to after their deposition. Thanks to the use of a climate chamber, we succeeded in reproducing alteration polish comparable to what is frequently observed on prehistoric stone tools, in particular those dating to the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods. The results open new possibilities for exploring the effect of post-depositional processes on the preservation of use traces and residues and demonstrate that alterations can also contribute to the understanding of site formation processes.},
