## Abstract

The surface of lithic stone tools from Paleolithic archaeological sites
can undergo a range of different postdepositional alterations, including
sedimentary erosion induced by water displacement or wind. The surface
of flint artifacts can reflect these alterations as changes in texture.
Microscopic analyses and grayscale images can be employed to obtain
quantitative data to help determine the degree to which the surfaces of
flint stone tools have been altered. However, surface quantitative
values depend directly on the image capturing system of each microscope.
This raises the question of whether the quantitative values are actually
capturing the evolution of the surface, whether they are dependent on
the type of microscope and its image capturing system, and whether the
detection of the degree of abrasion might vary depending on the type of
microscope. The present work sought to determine whether data extracted
from images from two different microscopes point to the same trends in
surface change due to postdepositional alterations. Surface photographs
of a sample of 25 flakes were taken using a Dino-Lite Edge 3.0
AM73915MZT and a 3D Optical Profiler Sensofar S neox 090. These flakes
represented three different stages of alteration (fresh, ten hours of
experimentally-induced sedimentary erosion, and geological neocortex).
Results from grayscale images indicate that, despite yielding different
numeric ranges, the quantitative values of the images from both types of
microscope reflect the same trends in surface change. The classification
accuracy of the three stages of erosion did not vary between
microscopes.

## 1) Introduction

Flint stone tools are among the most common remains recovered from
Paleolithic sites. They provide information not only about
chrono-cultural developments, but also about the behavioral and spatial
organization of Paleolithic groups. However, stone tools from
Paleolithic sites may be subjected to any number of postdepositional
alterations, most commonly water flow or wind abrasion
\[byers_flake_2015; Hosfield and Chambers
([2016](#ref-hosfield_flake_2016)); Michel et al.
([2019](#ref-michel_freezing_2019)); Petraglia and Potts
([1994](#ref-petraglia_water_1994)); Schick
([1986](#ref-schick_stone_1986))\]. These postdepositional processes can
disrupt archaeological remains, resulting in horizontal and vertical
mixing of artifacts and, consequently, unreliable chrono-cultural
interpretations. Therefore, a solid analysis of the integrity of a
lithic assemblage is needed prior to its interpretation.

Postdepositional alterations and their intensity are recorded on the
surface of stone tools, most commonly observed in the form of increased
ridge width and surface abrasion ([Burroni et al.,
2002](#ref-burroni_surface_2002); [Bustos-Pérez et al.,
2019](#ref-bustos-perez_experimental_2019); [Bustos-Pérez and Ollé,
2024](#ref-bustos-perez_quantification_2024); [Chambers,
2016](#ref-chambers_like_2016); [Shackley,
1974](#ref-shackley_stream_1974)). Unaided visual assessments of
sedimentary abrasion (rounding) can result in an error ratio of over
80%, emphasizing the need for microscopic analyses with quantitative
variables ([Chambers, 2016](#ref-chambers_like_2016)).

The quantitative characterization of surfaces is an important part of
many lithic microscopic analytical approaches. In recent traceological
studies, surface texture quantification is often used to identify worked
materials ([Evans and Donahue, 2008](#ref-evans_laser_2008); [Ibáñez et
al., 2019](#ref-ibanez_identifying_2019); [Ibáñez and Mazzucco,
2021](#ref-ibanez_quantitative_2021); [Macdonald,
2014](#ref-macdonald_application_2014); [Sferrazza,
2023](#ref-sferrazza_grey_2023); [Stemp and Chung,
2011](#ref-stemp_discrimination_2011); [Stevens et al.,
2010](#ref-stevens_practical_2010)) or test different models of polish
development ([Ibáñez and Mazzucco,
2021](#ref-ibanez_quantitative_2021)). Another area of lithic
microscopic analysis in which surface quantification plays a key role is
in the identification, characterization and estimation of the intensity
of postdepositional alterations on lithic artifacts ([Burroni et al.,
2002](#ref-burroni_surface_2002); [Bustos-Pérez et al.,
2019](#ref-bustos-perez_experimental_2019); [Caux et al.,
2018](#ref-caux_aspects_2018); [Chambers,
2016](#ref-chambers_like_2016); [Chu et al.,
2015](#ref-chu_micro-abrasion_2015); [Hiscock,
1985](#ref-hiscock_need_1985); [Hosfield et al.,
2000](#ref-hosfield_interpreting_2000); [Levi Sala,
1986](#ref-levi_sala_use_1986)). The development of these analyses has
been incorporated in studies focusing on the integrity of the lithic
artifacts in archaeological assemblages ([Fraile-Márquez et al.,
2022](#ref-fraile-marquez_facing_2022); [Galland et al.,
2019](#ref-galland_quantifying_2019); [Staurset et al.,
2023](#ref-staurset_post-depositional_2023)).

Recent approaches using sequential experimentation, grayscale images
([Bustos-Pérez and Ollé, 2024](#ref-bustos-perez_quantification_2024);
[Sferrazza, 2023](#ref-sferrazza_grey_2023)) and texture metrics
([Haralick et al., 1973](#ref-haralick_textural_1973)) have demonstrated
the viability of quantifying surface changes caused by sedimentary
abrasion on flint tools. However, the information contained in the
pixels of a photograph may vary according to the capturing system of
each microscope. This raises the issue of the importance of microscope
agnosticism (meaning that metric values or trends do not vary in
relation to the choice of microscope). In the present study, we explored
four aspects to explore the issue of microscope agnosticism in relation
to sedimentary abrasion.

1)  Observed trends in quantitative metrics should be consistent
    independent of the choice of microscope. The combination of
    sequential experimentation and quantitative metrics ([Bustos-Pérez
    and Ollé, 2024](#ref-bustos-perez_quantification_2024); [Ibáñez and
    Mazzucco, 2021](#ref-ibanez_quantitative_2021); [Ollé and Vergès,
    2014](#ref-olle_use_2014)) has resulted in a certain degree of
    confidence regarding how the surface of flint changes progressively
    as result of a mechanical action. However, the current understanding
    of this change is directly related to the image acquisition
    procedure and the quantitative variables derived from those images.
    Ideally, quantitative trends would remain consistent regardless of
    the type of microscope used.

2)  Collinearity or multicollinearity of metric features extracted from
    images should be considered. Several approaches ([Bustos-Pérez and
    Ollé, 2024](#ref-bustos-perez_quantification_2024); [Ibáñez and
    Mazzucco, 2021](#ref-ibanez_quantitative_2021); [Pedergnana et al.,
    2020](#ref-pedergnana_polish_2020); [Sferrazza,
    2023](#ref-sferrazza_grey_2023); [Stevens et al.,
    2010](#ref-stevens_practical_2010)) use machine learning (ML)
    classification algorithms on metric features extracted from images.
    Along with higher accuracy, one substantial advantage of ML
    algorithms is that they can provide insights into feature importance
    for classification. Collinearity is generally not considered
    problematic for classification metrics, provided that any
    collinearity present in the training set is also present in the
    predicted sample. However, collinearity is considered to have
    substantial effects on interpreting feature importance due to
    unstable coefficients or redundancy in feature selection. Thus, it
    is important to be aware of the presence of collinear or
    multicollinear variables when using quantitative features extracted
    from images. Images of the same area from different microscopes will
    vary depending on the image acquiring system, and as a consequence,
    the presence of collinearity among the extracted features is also
    expected to vary from microscope to microscope. A microscope
    generating images with fewer pairs of collinear variables can be
    considered more reliable for the quantitative characterization of a
    surface.

3)  Classification accuracy should remain similar despite the use of
    variables obtained from the images of different microscopes.
    Accuracy can be affected when multicollinearity is present among the
    variables. A common approach to this problem is the use of
    dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, t-SNE; Naes and Mevik
    ([2001](#ref-naes_understanding_2001))), which make it possible to
    combine multiple collinear variables while avoiding the loss of
    information. If multicollinearity is present, the accuracy of a
    model using raw variables should be compared with a model using
    dimensionally reduced variables.

4)  Consistency of variable importance among classification algorithms
    and photographs obtained from different microscopes is a good
    indicator of microscope agnosticism. However, as previously
    indicated, variable importance can be affected by collinearity among
    predictors. This is an important consideration since the importance
    of a pair of variables might be a result of their collinearity.
    Additionally, it makes it possible to consider which groups of
    metric variables should be emphasized when analyzing surface change
    due to a given mechanical action.

## 2) Methods

### 2.1) Experimental sample and cleaning protocol

The sample consisted of 25 flakes experimentally knapped by one of the
authors (GBP) using direct percussion with a hard hammer. The flakes
came from three different types of flint (Table 1), all of them south
Madrid Miocene flint ([Bustillo et al.,
2012](#ref-bustillo_caracterizacion_2012); [Bustillo and Pérez-Jiménez,
2005](#ref-bustillo_caracteristicas_2005)) from different locations.
South Madrid Miocene flints were formed by the replacement of
sedimentary rocks which had filled the original basin, which is thought
to have taken place under continental conditions such as alluvial plain
deposits, shallow lacustrine waters, and marshes ([Bustillo et al.,
2012](#ref-bustillo_caracterizacion_2012)). Macroscopic analysis of the
flints shows that they present a fine, opaque, homogeneous surface and
blue/grey and reddish/ocher coloration. There is also a relative absence
of opal in these flints, although geodes and pseudo-morphs are sometimes
present.

Five type 1 and 2 flakes were analyzed to obtain images of the fresh
surface, while four type 1 flakes and five type 2 flakes were submitted
to ten hours of rounding in a tumbling machine (KT-3010 SUPER-TUMBLER).
The sedimentary matrix employed to simulate rounding consisted of a mix
of sand and water (a total weight of 5 kg of which 30–40% was water).
Sediment was obtained from the quaternary levels of the Madrid basin and
was made up of fine quartz sands with silt and partial carbonation. The
tumbler machine was set at continuous direction at 83 rpm. The average
weight of the flakes introduced into the tumbler was 26.25 g.

Geological images of the neocortex were obtained from three type 3
flakes and three type 2 flakes (Table 2). These images of geological
neocortex serve as reference samples for extreme levels of sedimentary
abrasion.

Possible contaminants were removed by means of a multi-step procedure
based on a previous study \[Pedergnana et al.
([2016](#ref-pedergnana_modern_2016)). The present study used a two-step
procedure consisting of an ultrasonic bath (frequency of 40 kHz) in a 2%
neutral soap (Derquim) solution for 10 to 15 minutes, followed by a
second sonic bath in pure acetone for another 10 to 15 minutes. After
each step, the lithic artifacts were placed in a tap water bath and
finally dried using compressed air. During the cleaning protocol and
microscopic analysis, all artifacts were handled using powder-free
surgical gloves.

### 2.2) Image acquisition and processing

In order to compare images, the field of view (FOV) and pixel ratio of
both microscopes must be as similar as possible. Parameters of the
Dino-Lite Edge 3.0 AM73915MZT were kept the same as in previous
experiments ([Bustos-Pérez and Ollé,
2024](#ref-bustos-perez_quantification_2024)), with a FOV of 3.28 x 2.46
mm and a pixel ratio of 2548 x 1918. As a result, each pixel measured
1.28 μm (width) by 1.28 μm (height). The Dino-Lite Edge 3.0 AM73915MZT
microscope was mounted in a Dino-Lite RK-06-AE stand in order to ensure
verticality, and a N3C-D2 diffuser cap was used to ensure the even
distribution of light. In the process of taking each photograph, the
region of interest on the flint was manually positioned as horizontally
as possible ([Calandra et al., 2022](#ref-calandra_surface_2022)). To
avoid problems due to focus variation, each surface was photographed
several times at different heights, and the sequences obtained were
mounted using a Helicon Focus 7.7.2. Normally, satisfactory stacking
required between two and four images, although additional images were
employed when needed.

<figure>
<img src="Figures/02-Neocortex-comparision.png"

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example of two images from the same
neocortex surface. Left: Sensofar S neox 090; right: Dino-Lite Edge 3.0
AM73915MZT. Both images after processing using Fiji/ImageJ</figcaption>
</figure>

The Sensofar S neox 090 zoom was manually adjusted to the most similar
FOV (3.18 x 2.65 mm) with 2x2 mosaics taken for each image. All images
were obtained using a x10 objective lens (numerical aperture 0.30) in
light scanning confocal mode (microdisplay scanning confocal microscopy)
at 5 Mp resolution with at least 95% of the information retrieved. The
original Sensofar S neox 090 photographs had a pixel ratio of 4616 x
3848. This resulted in each pixel measuring 0.69 x 0.69 μm. In order to
match the FOV and pixel ratio of the Sensofar S neox 090 zoom to those
of MP previous studies ([Bustos-Pérez and Ollé,
2024](#ref-bustos-perez_quantification_2024)), the images were cropped
and the pixels downsampled. Although the images from the Dino-Lite Edge
3.0 AM73915MZT microscope were slightly wider (0.10 mm), this resulted
in almost identical FOV, pixel ratios and pixel widths/heights (Table
3).

Both sets of images underwent the same two-step image treatment
procedure employed in a previous study ([Bustos-Pérez and Ollé,
2024](#ref-bustos-perez_quantification_2024)). First, the Fiji
([Schindelin et al., 2015](#ref-schindelin_imagej_2015)) “subtract
background” plugin was used to minimize the effects of different
lighting and differing flint coloration. Second, the “enhance contrast”
function was used to desaturate the images by normalizing their
histograms. This process provided a gray-level image for use as input
for the statistical analysis. All analyzed images were in TIFF format.

![Examples of heavily developed abrasion. Images are of the same flint.

Photographs of fresh and neocortex surfaces were obtained in the same
areas with both microscopes. The surface of the flakes that had
undergone 10h of rounding was initially recognized with both types of
microscopes and the most-developed surfaces were photographed. This is a
common procedure when analyzing microscopic traces, as the
most-developed area ([Ibáñez and Mazzucco,
2021](#ref-ibanez_quantitative_2021); [Pedergnana et al.,
2020](#ref-pedergnana_polish_2020)) is targeted for photography. This
ensured the maximum visibility of the abrasion for each microscope.

### 2.3) Quantitative analysis

Three groups of metrics were extracted from the microscope images (Table
4). The first group corresponds to descriptive statistics of the
gray-level values in each image, which can be divided into measures of
central tendency (mean, mode and median), and measures of deviation and
distribution (standard deviation, kurtosis and skewness).

The second group corresponds to measures of roughness. The Fiji/ImageJ
([Collins, 2007](#ref-collins_imagej_2007); [Schindelin et al.,
2015](#ref-schindelin_imagej_2015), [2012](#ref-schindelin_fiji_2012))
SurfCharJ plugin ([Chinga et al.,
2007](#ref-chinga_quantification_2007); [Chinga and Dougherty,
2002](#ref-chinga_roughness_2002)) was employed to obtain measures of Rq
(root mean square deviation/roughness), Ra (arithmetical mean
deviation), Rsk (skewness of the assessed profile) and Rku (kurtosis of
the assessed profile). Profiles of the whole surface (those with the “R”
prefix) were employed as input, and measures were calculated following
the ISO 4287/2000 standard ([Chinga et al.,
2007](#ref-chinga_quantification_2007); [Chinga and Dougherty,
2002](#ref-chinga_roughness_2002)).

Texture measures take into consideration the spatial distribution and
intensity values of the pixels from a grayscale image ([Haralick et al.,
1973](#ref-haralick_textural_1973)). The spatial distribution and
intensity are analyzed through a gray-level covariance matrix (GLCM).
This process works in two steps. First, for a given distance and
direction, a matrix is built that captures the relationship of intensity
between pairs of pixels (reference and neighbor). Second, for every x
and y it considers the co-occurrence of values, forming a new matrix.
This matrix makes it possible to obtain a series of statistical
descriptors ([Haralick et al., 1973](#ref-haralick_textural_1973)): the
angular second moment (ASM), contrast (CONT), correlation (CORR),
inverse different moment (IDM) and entropy (ENT). Based on previous
studies ([Bustos-Pérez and Ollé,
2024](#ref-bustos-perez_quantification_2024)), four distances (5, 10, 15
and 20 pixels) and all four possible directions (north, east, south,
west) were employed to create the GLCM and extract the features.

Two procedures were used to address the issue of collinearity among the
predictors. The first of these was the removal of collinear variables
using a pairwise cutoff discard procedure with a matrix representing the
linear correlation ($r^2$) of each pair of variables. For pairs of
variables presenting a correlation above a given threshold, the variable
presenting the highest average correlation (among all variables) was
removed. An arbitrary cutoff threshold of 0.9 was selected. A visual
evaluation of variable relationships showed that this threshold
prevented the exclusion of pairs of variables presenting polynomial or
logarithmic relationships. In the second procedure, dimensionality was
reduced through a principal component analysis (PCA), which identifies
the linear combinations that best represent the variables in an
unsupervised manner ([James et al., 2013](#ref-james_introduction_2013);
[Pearson, 1901](#ref-pearson_lines_1901)). Principal components (PCs)
capture as much variance as possible for the complete dataset. This is
especially useful when several collinear variables will be combined as a
single variable, as it ensures a minimum loss of information ([James et
al., 2013](#ref-james_introduction_2013); [Yang and Yang,
2003](#ref-yang_why_2003)). Consistency among the variable trend of data
from both microscopes was evaluated through visual exploratory analysis
and statistical differences between each consecutive episode of
abrasion.

A previous study ([Bustos-Pérez and Ollé,
2024](#ref-bustos-perez_quantification_2024)) using the same type of
metrics showed that the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) provided the
best results for classification. LDA reduces the dimensionality of the
data aiming to maximize the separation between classes while decision
boundaries divide the predicted classes into regions ([Fisher,
1936](#ref-fisher_use_1936); [James et al.,
2013](#ref-james_introduction_2013)). In the present study, three sets
of LDA models were trained for each group of images. The first model was
trained using the complete set of variables, second model was trained
using the set of variables remaining from the pairwise cutoff to avoid
collinearity, and the third model was trained after conducting a PCA for
dimensionality reduction.  
All models were evaluated using 10 x 50 k-fold cross-validation (10
folds and 50 cycles), which provided measures of accuracy. Using a
10-fold division, each fold from the Dino-Lite Edge 3.0 AM73915MZT
images was composed of 26 images, while each fold from Sensofar S neox
090 was composed of 28 images. Each fold subsequently acted as a test
set for a trained model. Although computationally more expensive, this
guaranteed that all data points served as test sets. At the start of
each of the 50 cycles, and prior to fold division, the images were
randomly shuffled, ensuring that the composition of the folds varied in
each cycle and that composition did not play a significant role in the
evaluation of the models.  
Two measures were selected for the evaluation of the machine learning
models: accuracy and area under the curve (AUC). Accuracy indicates the
success rate of a model, representing the proportion of times in which a
class was correctly identified ([Lantz, 2019](#ref-lantz_machine_2019)).
Accuracy is usually calculated using a 0.5 threshold for class
assignation. However, classification thresholds can be modified to
balance the ability of the model to detect true positives and avoid
false positives (sensitivity and specificity). The receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve makes it possible to systematically evaluate
the ratio of detected true positives, while avoiding false positives,
for a given threshold ([Bradley, 1997](#ref-bradley_use_1997);
[Spackman, 1989](#ref-spackman_signal_1989)). The ROC curve makes it
possible to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) with a value that
can range from 1 (perfect classifier) to 0, and a value of 0.5
representing a random classifier. In the present study, only the general
AUC value of model performance was considered. The general AUC was
calculated from the average of each AUC class ([Hand and Till,
2001](#ref-hand_simple_2001); [Robin et al.,
2011](#ref-robin_proc_2011)).  
Machine learning models make it possible to estimate the importance of
variables for classification. In the present study, variable importance
was calculated only for LDA models trained on non-collinear sets of
variables.

The statistical study was conducted using R version 4.3.1 in the IDE
RStudio version 2023.09.0 ([R. C. Team, 2019](#ref-r_core_team_r_2019);
[Rs. Team, 2019](#ref-rstudio_team_rstudio_2019)). Data were managed and
graphs created using the tidyverse v.2.0.0 package ([Wickham et al.,
2019](#ref-wickham_welcome_2019)). LDA models were trained using MASS
(Modern Applied Statistics with S) v.7.3.60 ([Venables and Ripley,
2002](#ref-venables_modern_2002)). The k-fold cross validation of all
models, precision metrics, the pairwise discard of collinear variables,
and variable importance were performed using the caret package v.6.0.94
([Kuhn, 2008](#ref-kuhn_building_2008)). ROC curves and AUC values were
obtained using the pROC v.1.18.5 package ([Robin et al.,
2011](#ref-robin_proc_2011)).  
Currently, all data, code and the complete workflow needed to perform
the analysis is made freely available as an open repository at Github
using an RMarkdown document ([Xie et al., 2018](#ref-xie_r_2018); [Xie,
2014](#ref-xie_knitr_2014)). If the current draft is accepted for
publication, the repository will be made available at Zenodo.

## 3) Results

### 3.1) Trends of metric variables

    Table 5 summarizes the observed trends and consistency between microscopes for the variables employed in the analysis. Images from the Dino-Lite Edge 3.0 AM73915MZT show clear trends for all variables and for all three stages of mechanical action considered. The interpretation of the images from the Sensofar S neox 090 was not nearly as clear, with no statistical differences between stages of abrasion for several of the variables.    

Clear consistency between microscopes was observed for seven variables
(mean of pixel values, standard deviation, Sk, Ku, Rq, Ra and CONT) in
the form of the same trends and marked statistical differences between
values of variables according to stage of abrasion. Two additional
variables (median and CORR) presented p values at the limit of
significant statistical difference, with the presence of several
outliers obfuscating the apparent trends among values.
