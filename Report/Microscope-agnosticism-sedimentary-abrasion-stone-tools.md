## Abstract

The surface of lithic stone tools from Paleolithic archaeological sites
can undergo a range of different postdepositional alterations, including
sedimentary erosion induced by water displacement or wind. The surface
of flint artifacts can reflect these alterations as changes in texture.
Microscopic analyses and grayscale images can be employed to obtain
quantitative data to help determine the degree to which the surfaces of
flint stone tools have been altered. However, surface quantitative
values depend directly on the image capturing system of each microscope.
This raises the question of whether the quantitative values are actually
capturing the evolution of the surface, whether they are dependent on
the type of microscope and its image capturing system, and whether the
detection of the degree of abrasion might vary depending on the type of
microscope. The present work sought to determine whether data extracted
from images from two different microscopes point to the same trends in
surface change due to postdepositional alterations. Surface photographs
of a sample of 25 flakes were taken using a Dino-Lite Edge 3.0
AM73915MZT and a 3D Optical Profiler Sensofar S neox 090. These flakes
represented three different stages of alteration (fresh, ten hours of
experimentally-induced sedimentary erosion, and geological neocortex).
Results from grayscale images indicate that, despite yielding different
numeric ranges, the quantitative values of the images from both types of
microscope reflect the same trends in surface change. The classification
accuracy of the three stages of erosion did not vary between
microscopes.

## 1) Introduction

Flint stone tools are among the most common remains recovered from
Paleolithic sites. They provide information not only about
chrono-cultural developments, but also about the behavioral and spatial
organization of Paleolithic groups. However, stone tools from
Paleolithic sites may be subjected to any number of postdepositional
alterations, most commonly water flow or wind abrasion
\[byers_flake_2015; Hosfield and Chambers
([2016](#ref-hosfield_flake_2016)); Michel et al.
([2019](#ref-michel_freezing_2019)); Petraglia and Potts
([1994](#ref-petraglia_water_1994)); Schick
([1986](#ref-schick_stone_1986))\]. These postdepositional processes can
disrupt archaeological remains, resulting in horizontal and vertical
mixing of artifacts and, consequently, unreliable chrono-cultural
interpretations. Therefore, a solid analysis of the integrity of a
lithic assemblage is needed prior to its interpretation.

Postdepositional alterations and their intensity are recorded on the
surface of stone tools, most commonly observed in the form of increased
ridge width and surface abrasion ([Burroni et al.,
2002](#ref-burroni_surface_2002); [Bustos-Pérez et al.,
2019](#ref-bustos-perez_experimental_2019); [Bustos-Pérez and Ollé,
2024](#ref-bustos-perez_quantification_2024); [Chambers,
2016](#ref-chambers_like_2016); [Shackley,
1974](#ref-shackley_stream_1974)). Unaided visual assessments of
sedimentary abrasion (rounding) can result in an error ratio of over
80%, emphasizing the need for microscopic analyses with quantitative
variables ([Chambers, 2016](#ref-chambers_like_2016)).

The quantitative characterization of surfaces is an important part of
many lithic microscopic analytical approaches. In recent traceological
studies, surface texture quantification is often used to identify worked
materials ([Evans and Donahue, 2008](#ref-evans_laser_2008); [Ibáñez et
al., 2019](#ref-ibanez_identifying_2019); [Ibáñez and Mazzucco,
2021](#ref-ibanez_quantitative_2021); [Macdonald,
2014](#ref-macdonald_application_2014); [Sferrazza,
2023](#ref-sferrazza_grey_2023); [Stemp and Chung,
2011](#ref-stemp_discrimination_2011); [Stevens et al.,
2010](#ref-stevens_practical_2010)) or test different models of polish
development ([Ibáñez and Mazzucco,
2021](#ref-ibanez_quantitative_2021)). Another area of lithic
microscopic analysis in which surface quantification plays a key role is
in the identification, characterization and estimation of the intensity
of postdepositional alterations on lithic artifacts ([Burroni et al.,
2002](#ref-burroni_surface_2002); [Bustos-Pérez et al.,
2019](#ref-bustos-perez_experimental_2019); [Caux et al.,
2018](#ref-caux_aspects_2018); [Chambers,
2016](#ref-chambers_like_2016); [Chu et al.,
2015](#ref-chu_micro-abrasion_2015); [Hiscock,
1985](#ref-hiscock_need_1985); [Hosfield et al.,
2000](#ref-hosfield_interpreting_2000); [Levi Sala,
1986](#ref-levi_sala_use_1986)). The development of these analyses has
been incorporated in studies focusing on the integrity of the lithic
artifacts in archaeological assemblages ([Fraile-Márquez et al.,
2022](#ref-fraile-marquez_facing_2022); [Galland et al.,
2019](#ref-galland_quantifying_2019); [Staurset et al.,
2023](#ref-staurset_post-depositional_2023)).

Recent approaches using sequential experimentation, grayscale images
([Bustos-Pérez and Ollé, 2024](#ref-bustos-perez_quantification_2024);
[Sferrazza, 2023](#ref-sferrazza_grey_2023)) and texture metrics
([Haralick et al., 1973](#ref-haralick_textural_1973)) have demonstrated
the viability of quantifying surface changes caused by sedimentary
abrasion on flint tools. However, the information contained in the
pixels of a photograph may vary according to the capturing system of
each microscope. This raises the issue of the importance of microscope
agnosticism (meaning that metric values or trends do not vary in
relation to the choice of microscope). In the present study, we explored
four aspects to explore the issue of microscope agnosticism in relation
to sedimentary abrasion.

1)  Observed trends in quantitative metrics should be consistent
    independent of the choice of microscope. The combination of
    sequential experimentation and quantitative metrics ([Bustos-Pérez
    and Ollé, 2024](#ref-bustos-perez_quantification_2024); [Ibáñez and
    Mazzucco, 2021](#ref-ibanez_quantitative_2021); [Ollé and Vergès,
    2014](#ref-olle_use_2014)) has resulted in a certain degree of
    confidence regarding how the surface of flint changes progressively
    as result of a mechanical action. However, the current understanding
    of this change is directly related to the image acquisition
    procedure and the quantitative variables derived from those images.
    Ideally, quantitative trends would remain consistent regardless of
    the type of microscope used.

2)  Collinearity or multicollinearity of metric features extracted from
    images should be considered. Several approaches ([Bustos-Pérez and
    Ollé, 2024](#ref-bustos-perez_quantification_2024); [Ibáñez and
    Mazzucco, 2021](#ref-ibanez_quantitative_2021); [Pedergnana et al.,
    2020](#ref-pedergnana_polish_2020); [Sferrazza,
    2023](#ref-sferrazza_grey_2023); [Stevens et al.,
    2010](#ref-stevens_practical_2010)) use machine learning (ML)
    classification algorithms on metric features extracted from images.
    Along with higher accuracy, one substantial advantage of ML
    algorithms is that they can provide insights into feature importance
    for classification. Collinearity is generally not considered
    problematic for classification metrics, provided that any
    collinearity present in the training set is also present in the
    predicted sample. However, collinearity is considered to have
    substantial effects on interpreting feature importance due to
    unstable coefficients or redundancy in feature selection. Thus, it
    is important to be aware of the presence of collinear or
    multicollinear variables when using quantitative features extracted
    from images. Images of the same area from different microscopes will
    vary depending on the image acquiring system, and as a consequence,
    the presence of collinearity among the extracted features is also
    expected to vary from microscope to microscope. A microscope
    generating images with fewer pairs of collinear variables can be
    considered more reliable for the quantitative characterization of a
    surface.

3)  Classification accuracy should remain similar despite the use of
    variables obtained from the images of different microscopes.
    Accuracy can be affected when multicollinearity is present among the
    variables. A common approach to this problem is the use of
    dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, t-SNE; Naes and Mevik
    ([2001](#ref-naes_understanding_2001))), which make it possible to
    combine multiple collinear variables while avoiding the loss of
    information. If multicollinearity is present, the accuracy of a
    model using raw variables should be compared with a model using
    dimensionally reduced variables.

4)  Consistency of variable importance among classification algorithms
    and photographs obtained from different microscopes is a good
    indicator of microscope agnosticism. However, as previously
    indicated, variable importance can be affected by collinearity among
    predictors. This is an important consideration since the importance
    of a pair of variables might be a result of their collinearity.
    Additionally, it makes it possible to consider which groups of
    metric variables should be emphasized when analyzing surface change
    due to a given mechanical action.

## 2) Methods

### 2.1) Experimental sample and cleaning protocol

The sample consisted of 25 flakes experimentally knapped by one of the
authors (GBP) using direct percussion with a hard hammer. The flakes
came from three different types of flint (Table 1), all of them south
Madrid Miocene flint ([Bustillo et al.,
2012](#ref-bustillo_caracterizacion_2012); [Bustillo and Pérez-Jiménez,
2005](#ref-bustillo_caracteristicas_2005)) from different locations.
South Madrid Miocene flints were formed by the replacement of
sedimentary rocks which had filled the original basin, which is thought
to have taken place under continental conditions such as alluvial plain
deposits, shallow lacustrine waters, and marshes ([Bustillo et al.,
2012](#ref-bustillo_caracterizacion_2012)). Macroscopic analysis of the
flints shows that they present a fine, opaque, homogeneous surface and
blue/grey and reddish/ocher coloration. There is also a relative absence
of opal in these flints, although geodes and pseudo-morphs are sometimes
present.

Five type 1 and 2 flakes were analyzed to obtain images of the fresh
surface, while four type 1 flakes and five type 2 flakes were submitted
to ten hours of rounding in a tumbling machine (KT-3010 SUPER-TUMBLER).
The sedimentary matrix employed to simulate rounding consisted of a mix
of sand and water (a total weight of 5 kg of which 30–40% was water).
Sediment was obtained from the quaternary levels of the Madrid basin and
was made up of fine quartz sands with silt and partial carbonation. The
tumbler machine was set at continuous direction at 83 rpm. The average
weight of the flakes introduced into the tumbler was 26.25 g.

Geological images of the neocortex were obtained from three type 3
flakes and three type 2 flakes (Table 2). These images of geological
neocortex serve as reference samples for extreme levels of sedimentary
abrasion.

Possible contaminants were removed by means of a multi-step procedure
based on a previous study \[Pedergnana et al.
([2016](#ref-pedergnana_modern_2016)). The present study used a two-step
procedure consisting of an ultrasonic bath (frequency of 40 kHz) in a 2%
neutral soap (Derquim) solution for 10 to 15 minutes, followed by a
second sonic bath in pure acetone for another 10 to 15 minutes. After
each step, the lithic artifacts were placed in a tap water bath and
finally dried using compressed air. During the cleaning protocol and
microscopic analysis, all artifacts were handled using powder-free
surgical gloves.

### 2.2) Image acquisition and processing

In order to compare images, the field of view (FOV) and pixel ratio of
both microscopes must be as similar as possible. Parameters of the
Dino-Lite Edge 3.0 AM73915MZT were kept the same as in previous
experiments ([Bustos-Pérez and Ollé,
2024](#ref-bustos-perez_quantification_2024)), with a FOV of 3.28 x 2.46
mm and a pixel ratio of 2548 x 1918. As a result, each pixel measured
1.28 μm (width) by 1.28 μm (height). The Dino-Lite Edge 3.0 AM73915MZT
microscope was mounted in a Dino-Lite RK-06-AE stand in order to ensure
verticality, and a N3C-D2 diffuser cap was used to ensure the even
distribution of light. In the process of taking each photograph, the
region of interest on the flint was manually positioned as horizontally
as possible ([Calandra et al., 2022](#ref-calandra_surface_2022)). To
avoid problems due to focus variation, each surface was photographed
several times at different heights, and the sequences obtained were
mounted using a Helicon Focus 7.7.2. Normally, satisfactory stacking
required between two and four images, although additional images were
employed when needed.

<figure>
<img src="Figures/02-Neocortex-comparision.png"

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example of two images from the same
neocortex surface. Left: Sensofar S neox 090; right: Dino-Lite Edge 3.0
AM73915MZT. Both images after processing using Fiji/ImageJ</figcaption>
</figure>

The Sensofar S neox 090 zoom was manually adjusted to the most similar
FOV (3.18 x 2.65 mm) with 2x2 mosaics taken for each image. All images
were obtained using a x10 objective lens (numerical aperture 0.30) in
light scanning confocal mode (microdisplay scanning confocal microscopy)
at 5 Mp resolution with at least 95% of the information retrieved. The
original Sensofar S neox 090 photographs had a pixel ratio of 4616 x
3848. This resulted in each pixel measuring 0.69 x 0.69 μm. In order to
match the FOV and pixel ratio of the Sensofar S neox 090 zoom to those
of MP previous studies ([Bustos-Pérez and Ollé,
2024](#ref-bustos-perez_quantification_2024)), the images were cropped
and the pixels downsampled. Although the images from the Dino-Lite Edge
3.0 AM73915MZT microscope were slightly wider (0.10 mm), this resulted
in almost identical FOV, pixel ratios and pixel widths/heights (Table
3).

Both sets of images underwent the same two-step image treatment
procedure employed in a previous study ([Bustos-Pérez and Ollé,
2024](#ref-bustos-perez_quantification_2024)). First, the Fiji
([Schindelin et al., 2015](#ref-schindelin_imagej_2015)) “subtract
background” plugin was used to minimize the effects of different
lighting and differing flint coloration. Second, the “enhance contrast”
function was used to desaturate the images by normalizing their
histograms. This process provided a gray-level image for use as input
for the statistical analysis. All analyzed images were in TIFF format.

![Examples of heavily developed abrasion. Images are of the same flint.

Photographs of fresh and neocortex surfaces were obtained in the same
areas with both microscopes. The surface of the flakes that had
undergone 10h of rounding was initially recognized with both types of
microscopes and the most-developed surfaces were photographed. This is a
common procedure when analyzing microscopic traces, as the
most-developed area ([Ibáñez and Mazzucco,
2021](#ref-ibanez_quantitative_2021); [Pedergnana et al.,
2020](#ref-pedergnana_polish_2020)) is targeted for photography. This
ensured the maximum visibility of the abrasion for each microscope.

### 2.3) Quantitative analysis

Three groups of metrics were extracted from the microscope images (Table
4). The first group corresponds to descriptive statistics of the
gray-level values in each image, which can be divided into measures of
central tendency (mean, mode and median), and measures of deviation and
distribution (standard deviation, kurtosis and skewness).
