## Abstract

The surface of lithic stone tools from Paleolithic archaeological sites
can suffer different postdepositional alterations, such as sedimentary
erosion induced by water displacement or wind. The surface of flint
artifacts can record these alterations as changes in the texture.
Microscopic analysis and grayscale images can be employed to obtain
quantitative data to help determine the degree of alteration undergone
by the surface of a flint stone tool. However, surface quantitative
values depend directly on the image capturing system of each microscope.
This raises the question regarding if the quantitative values are
actually capturing the evolution of a surface, if they are dependent on
the type of microscope and its image capturing system, and if the
detection of the degree of abrasion will vary depending on the type of
microscope. The present work sets to determine if data extracted from
images from two different microscopes show the same trends in surface
change when postdepositional alterations occur. Surface photographs of a
sample of 25 flakes were taken using a Dino-Lite Edge 3.0 AM73915MZT and
a 3D Optical Profiler Sensofar S neox 090. These flakes represented
three different stages of alteration (fresh, ten hours of experimentally
induced sedimentary erosion, and geological neocortex). Results of
quantitative values from grayscale level images indicate that, despite
providing different numeric ranges, quantitative values from images of
both types of microscopes reflect the same trends in surface change. The
classification accuracy of the three stages of slurry erosion did not
vary between microscopes.

## Introduction

Flint stone tools are some of the most common remains from Paleolithic
sites. They provide information about chrono-cultural developments along
with the behavioral and spatial organization of Paleolithic groups.
However, stone tools from Paleolithic sites might suffer a series of
postdepositional alterations, with water flow or wind abrasion being
some of the most common ([Byers et al., 2015](#ref-byers_flake_2015);
[Hosfield and Chambers, 2016](#ref-hosfield_flake_2016))

(Byers et al., 2015; Hosfield and Chambers, 2016; Michel et al., 2019;
Petraglia and Potts, 1994; Schick, 1986). These postdepositional
alterations can disrupt archaeological remains, resulting in horizontal
and vertical mixing of artifacts, with on unreliable chrono-cultural
interpretations. As a result of this, a good analysis of lithic
assemblage integrity is needed prior to its interpretation.
