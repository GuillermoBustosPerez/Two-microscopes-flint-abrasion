## **Abstract**   

The surface of lithic stone tools from Paleolithic archaeological sites can undergo a range of different postdepositional alterations, including sedimentary erosion induced by water displacement or wind. The surface of flint artifacts can reflect these alterations as changes in texture. Microscopic analyses and grayscale images can be employed to obtain quantitative data to help determine the degree to which the surfaces of flint stone tools have been altered. However, surface quantitative values depend directly on the image capturing system of each microscope. This raises the question of whether the quantitative values are actually capturing the evolution of the surface, whether they are dependent on the type of microscope and its image capturing system, and whether the detection of the degree of abrasion might vary depending on the type of microscope. The present work sought to determine whether data extracted from images from two different microscopes point to the same trends in surface change due to postdepositional alterations. Surface photographs of a sample of 25 flakes were taken using a Dino-Lite Edge 3.0 AM73915MZT and a 3D Optical Profiler Sensofar S neox 090. These flakes represented three different stages of alteration (fresh, ten hours of experimentally-induced sedimentary erosion, and geological neocortex). Results from grayscale images indicate that, despite yielding different numeric ranges, the quantitative values of the images from both types of microscope reflect the same trends in surface change. The classification accuracy of the three stages of erosion did not vary between microscopes.

## **Structure of the repository**   

The following repository is organized following the structure of a *research compendium* (Marwick et al., 2018). The [**Report**](Report) folder contains all data, images and complete workflow to reproduce the current research. Within this folder the following subfolders can be found:   

  * [**Data**](Report/Data): contains *images from microscopes* used for analysis, along with the RData files containing the extracted metric features of each image and microscope type.    
  * [**Figures**](Report/Figures): contains externally produced figures included in the manuscript.   
  * [**Models**](Report/Models): contains all LDA models generated through the analysis. These are: models with all set of variables, models using Principal Components, and models with subset selection of variables.    
  * [**Scripts**](Report/Scripts): the script sourced to train the models.   

The manuscript is made available as a [**.md**](Report/Microscope-agnosticism-sedimentary-abrasion-stone-tools.md) or as a [**.Rmd**](Report/Microscope-agnosticism-sedimentary-abrasion-stone-tools.Rmd) file. These files contain the complete workflow to reproduce the analysis.
